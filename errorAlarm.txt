CALL watchFile with log file path and errorOccurred as callback


This code will have to be continuously running in the same server as the log file is in.
I'm not too worried about performance since the arithmetic operations with integers
are pretty quick and the array will rarely be too big, although if a critical endpoint
is failing and the app has a lot of users it can quickly fill up, so it may be worth
throttling the file watch or adding some logic to avoid pushing to the array too frequently.
